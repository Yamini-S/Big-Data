1. READING ASSIGNMENT
   Read the following papers, and submit a short summary for each paper.
   - Pairwise Document Similarity in Large Collections with MapReduce

2. Determine the average stock_price_adj_close value by the year.
Choose an implementation in which a Reducer could be used as a Combiner. (discussed in the lecture, and available in the slides).
 
3. Using the MoviLens dataset, determine the median and standard deviation of ratings per movie.
Iterate through the given set of values and add each value to an in-memory list. The iteration also calculates a running sum and count.
 
4. Redo Part 3 using Memory-Conscious Median and Standard Deviation implementation as explained in the Slides (MR Summarization Patterns Slides).
Use a Combiner for optimization.
